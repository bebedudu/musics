fix 

if currently index number 3 music is playing and when searched the music in search bar then it show the index number 3 as playing i.e. css effect of currently playing music

all favourite music is not playing only some of them are playing and show the favourite music in ascending order 

make it such that when search is done and clicked on "play searched" then only searched music list should be played in ascending order 



@index.html @script.js @styles.css can we make it such that when search is done and clicked on "play searched" then only searched music list should be played in ascending order from the searched music list

when the music is searched and played then it don't play that respetive music it plays the initially ordered music list for example if i play the 2nd music from the searched music then it's playing the second music of initially ordered music list
